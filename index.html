        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <br>
        <p>eSETU, after over a decade of building high end enterprise transaction systems for the Insurance, Finance, Telecom and Marketing segments, has developed a best practices method called S2DLC™ (SMART™ Solutions Development Life Cycle, the next generation SDLC). This methodology is followed by all eSETU consultants during the client engagement and starts with capturing all business processes, operations and activities utilizing formal techniques enabled by our suite of tools. Further, our automated business transformation tools convert the formal business specifications to an operational execution framework providing for accurate and agile development of all required work flow components, EAI components and Application software components. The execution framework assists the business in simulating the operational business value chains and also provides a platform to develop various KPIs to help monitor the business operations.</p>
        <br>
        <p>E-ValueFlow Designor™ enables the eSETU consultants to model business value chains within the enterprise. The tool through its very user friendly interface provides the eSETU consultants working very closely with the business analysts the ability to specify the value of a business enterprise by distinguishing between what is the business (core) and how to execute the business (operations) hence providing the business a road map to model formal unambiguous value chains across functions within the enterprise. Also, this pre-implementation formalism plays a important role in business decision making while building or buying automated IT solutions for each value chain.</p>
        <br>
        <p>E-ValueFlow DesignorPlus™ extends the power of the E-ValueFlow Designor™ to provide a very robust high end transaction based automated solution framework for each business value chain resulting in a generated transaction system on .Net and J2EE platforms. The enterprise has the ability to execute the automated solution for chosen value chains using the E-ValueFlow™ Business Simulator Platform. E-ValueFlow Monitor™ provides the enterprise the ability to monitor all the executing value chains for obtaining the business value. Also, all functionality to control the business value derived from the executing chains are provided through a very user friendly monitor console and a very good framework to build Performance Dashboards to monitor KPIs.</p>
